    <segment id="1" parent="2" relname="preparation">Great insight on durability.</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="12" relname="span"> Another aspect is when usability design
principles are carried over from one technology to the next instead of
doing a separate task analysis for the newer technology.</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="14" relname="concession">  Although it is
not always nevessary to reinvent the wheel,</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="19" relname="span"> you would not necessary want
to put bicycle wheels on your SUV.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="24" relname="span"> This issue was among several that
Nielsen (2000) pointed out as reasons 70% of people chose not to use WAP
(wireless access protocol) phones to access the Internet.</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="20" relname="span"> Many of the
design principles that worked well for traditional web design, such as
fancy designs and splash screens, just did not have a place on WAP
phone.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="5" relname="nonvolitional-cause"> One obvious reason was the difference in screen size that made it
more difficult to distinguish between options.</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="5" relname="nonvolitional-cause"> Also, more screens were
needed on WAP phones to display items that were designed for regular
larger screen PCs in mind.</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="15" relname="circumstance"> As we might have experienced,</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="21" relname="span"> the more
clicking one has to do to accomplish a task,</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="22" relname="span"> the more discouraging it is
to repeat that task;</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="18" relname="nonvolitional-cause"> and the more time spent using a cell phone,</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="23" relname="span"> the
higher the monthly bill.</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="25" relname="span"> Nielsen suggested that much simpler design
approaches were necessary to make accessing the web via WAP phones
faster, clearer, with as few clicks and screens as possible.</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="9" relname="elaboration"> This also
meant using different approaches at task analysis than was used for web
design meant for the larger screens.</segment>
