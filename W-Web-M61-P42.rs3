Upon first glance the Medicare site is extremely unappealing.</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="25" relname="conjunction">  Many 
things about the site are confusing,</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="25" relname="conjunction"> and there is an abundance of 
information on the main page along with split areas to review.</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="23" relname="antithesis">  
Despite the overwhelming amount of information provided on the 
primary page,</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="26" relname="span"> information at the bottom of the site forces the user 
to scroll down.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="5" relname="nonvolitional-cause">  Often the elderly have problems with dexterity and 
the motor skills necessary to perform this action due to arthritis, 
other physical limitations, or inexperience with a keyboard or mouse 
(Hanson, 2004).</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="27" relname="span">  The benefits of less maneuvering cannot be 
discounted when developing a website for use by the elderly.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="28" relname="antithesis">    

The Medicare web developers seemed less concerned with 
aesthetics than presenting all the information possible.</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="28" relname="span">  However, 
the elderly user is more easily confused</segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="7" relname="condition"> if the information seems 
overwhelming (Karvonen, 2000).</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="30" relname="contrast">  Web design for the elderly 
demands simplicity and information that is distinctly separated is 
easier to navigate and comprehend.</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="30" relname="contrast">  The Medicare site seems very 
disorganized with not much thought given to commonly needed 
information.</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="35" relname="span">  

Another possible issue for elderly users is the lack of standardization 
on some of the linked pages.</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="33" relname="nonvolitional-cause">  The left hand menu was not 
accessible on some of the pages, possibly to cut down on 
distractions from the information</segment>
    <segment id="33" parent="34" relname="span"> but the user could not easily return 
to the main page or find the information they were viewing before.</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="32" relname="nonvolitional-cause">  
Often elderly users have memory impairments,</segment>
    <segment id="32" parent="36" relname="span"> so offering multiple 
ways to return to previous information will enhance the user 
experience.</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="41" relname="span">

The appearance and functionality of the Medicare website might 
have been improved by the use of a portal based system allowing 
the user to select several different options via GUI that would 
provide a more customized experience.</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="13" relname="elaboration">  For instance, certain text 
colors or font types might be easier to read for certain users who 
are visually impaired.</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="13" relname="elaboration">  Additionally, certain background colors might 
appeal to the user more or result in less eye strain overall.</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="13" relname="elaboration">   The key 
would be to design the GUI with ease of use for a wide range of user 
experience levels.</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="37" relname="concession">  Web designers tried to meet the needs of the 
intended users,</segment>
    <segment id="37" parent="38" relname="span"> but due to the diversity of elderly users the site must 
meet the skills, expectations, and needs of those intended users 
(Myers, 1994).</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="42" relname="span">

One positive attribute is the mouse-over function for multiple 
selections on the left hand portion of the site.</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="18" relname="evidence">  The selections are 
easy to make because they stay available without having to move 
over them quickly.</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="18" relname="volitional-result">  The designers definitely were concerned with 
ensuring elderly users could make the selections without the 
frustration of having to struggle with the mouse and the menu items 
if they disappeared.</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="43" relname="summary">

The Medicare site would be much more useful to elderly citizens if 
the web designers would attempt to be more creative in developing 
a site that would build confidence in users and provide information 
on Medicare benefits in a clear and organized manner.</segment>
