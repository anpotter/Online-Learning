After searching around on the Web, and consulting our book, I learned that intuitiveness 
is defined as something we use to determine a product&apos;s learnability features.</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="1" relname="restatement">  In other 
words, knowing how familiar a person can become with the product, and how quickly a 
person is able to grasp how to use it.</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="12" relname="sequence">  Suddenly, my cell phone just rung,</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="12" relname="sequence"> and after 
answering it, I realized how intuitive it was to learn how to use it.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="15" relname="span">  But, I quickly came to 
the conclusion that my phone was very intuitive not only because of the design,</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="4" relname="volitional-cause"> but 
because of my past experience using other phones.</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="16" relname="span">  So, I think it is safe to say that the 
experience or past knowledge of the user should fit some where in the definition of 
intuitiveness as well.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="31" relname="span">  But trying to describe how to measure it really began to cook my 
noodle.</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="25" relname="sequence">  After sipping on several cups of decaf coffee,</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="25" relname="sequence"> and going through several minutes 
of mental gymnastics,</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="24" relname="span"> I realized that the word seems to be more of a subjective, rather 
than objective term for usability and design;</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="26" relname="span"> and thus, appears to be a little more difficult 
to break down  quantitatively that is  into layers, elements, or components, </segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="27" relname="span">so that it 
can be measured as a metric of some type with respect to usability and design.</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="34" relname="span">  So, I 
searched further and found a useful article.</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="32" relname="span">  Spool (2005) articulates that the biggest 
challenge in making a design seem intuitive to users is learning where the current and 
target knowledge points are.</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="29" relname="span">  He points out that there are two very important questions 
that need to be addressed in order to build an intuitive interface:</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="28" relname="list">  (1) What do users 
already know,</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="28" relname="list"> and (2) What do they need to know?</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="9" relname="elaboration">   He further explains that the 
knowledge a user has when arriving at the design (current knowledge), what knowledge 
theyll need to complete their tasks (target knowledge), and what the design needs to do 
to help them complete the task (the gap) are the key ingredients for making an interface 
that seems intuitive to users.</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="30" relname="summary">  Thus, understanding the knowledge points of users, and 
knowing what a design needs to accomplish, is a good start in terms of measuring 
intuitiveness with respect to usability and design.
