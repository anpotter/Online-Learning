    <segment id="1" parent="43" relname="background">
The first thing that grabbed me when going to this site was the white area in the center of 
the web page.</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="43" relname="span"> It was hard to read</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="26" relname="conjunction"> because all the topics that were underlined,</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="26" relname="conjunction"> but they 
were close together.</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="28" relname="span">  The items that were under the &quot;Seach Tools&quot; area were really odd 
and hard to read because of three reasons:</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="27" relname="list">
1.  A sentence would be underlined and bunched in up to 4 lines.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="27" relname="list">
2.  The next sentence of some of these sentences looked like they could have been part 
of the previous sentence.</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="27" relname="list">  
3.  The diamonds in front of the sentences didn&apos;t visually line up to one another for the 
columns,</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="28" relname="evaluation"> and this bothered me for some reason.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="21" relname="concession">

I think that they made an effort to use a large font in this white area,</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="35" relname="span"> but it just looked 
like a blur.</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="36" relname="span">  I can say that I felt that there was too little white space on this homepage,</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="7" relname="justify"> 
similiar to what Barnum described on page 369 of our textbook, in that this page was 
difficult to read.</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="9" relname="concession">

I also noticed that there was a tab to choose &quot;screen reader version&quot; to allow for large 
fonts to show the page.</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="29" relname="span">  But...the next click on a link didn&apos;t carry this setting,</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="30" relname="span"> so a user 
would have to keep selecting the &quot;screen reader version&quot; option to every page that they 
wanted to show large fonts.</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="30" relname="evaluation">  I could see this as frustrating to someone that can&apos;t see 
very well.</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="38" relname="span">  Also with the format of the &quot;screen reader version&quot;, you could say that there 
was too much white space being used, which made it hard to read.</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="31" relname="span">  It is bad that it is 
hard to read</segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="32" relname="span"> becuase I am sure their goal during design was to allow for an easier read 
via large fonts.</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="24" relname="elaboration">  They could correct this by using a little shading.</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="39" relname="span">  I also noticed that there 
were no pictures...anywhere.</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="14" relname="elaboration">  I would have at least expected to see a picture of smiling 
senior citizens on the homepage.</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="25" relname="circumstance">  

Knowing how government can hire people to do work,</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="41" relname="span"> I think somebody&apos;s brother won 
the contract to design this website.</segment>
