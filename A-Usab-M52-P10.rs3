A great way to measure and understand the concepts of usability mentioned is to actually test it out in an application to which you are familiar.</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="18" relname="circumstance"> So, after reading about usability principles discussed in the text,</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="24" relname="span"> I decided to venture and use one of my favorite web apps (Hotmail) with efficiency, memorability, error recovery, user satisfaction, flexibility, and consistency in mind.</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="29" relname="span"> It is really interesting to look at it from such a perspective.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="25" relname="span"> You tend to appreciate the good designs implemented, and question the bad ones.</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="27" relname="span"> For instance, I felt that in designing the product, user efficiency, memorability and user satisfaction were major goals.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="5" relname="elaboration"> I was able to get done what I wanted to with little wasting time and effort.</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="5" relname="elaboration"> All the tools that I need to use where in the same place after every downloaded page,</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="5" relname="elaboration"> and I didnt have to go searching for the buttons or links for the things I wanted to do next.</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="28" relname="span"> It was easy to learn and I felt like I was in the driver seat</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="26" relname="span"> (Im always satisfied when I am in the drivers seat,</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="20" relname="volitional-result"> and feel like I know what I am doing).</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="22" relname="circumstance"> As far as flexibility was concerned,</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="35" relname="span"> it was up in the air.</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="32" relname="contrast"> At times I felt like there wasnt al lot of room.</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="32" relname="contrast"> And other times, I felt that there were so many ways I could perform a particular function.</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="33" relname="span"> For instance, there were enough avenues to move around my account, check my folders, move e-mails received, and so on.</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="31" relname="span"> However, there were times when I wanted to go back and forth from e-mail to e-mail with everything in front of me.</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="30" relname="span"> Well, I couldnt do that</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="14" relname="unless"> unless I went through the headache of opening up multiple browser windows.</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="31" relname="concession"> But I have to admit, there was consistency, and there was no way I could get lost.</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="37" relname="span"> Ahhhh Hotmail.</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="16" relname="elaboration"> Free and satisfying all the time.</segment>
