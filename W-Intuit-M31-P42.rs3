Any adult who has put their hands on a controller created for use with 
gaming consoles like Playstation2 or X-Box knows these controllers seem to 
have been created for an alien life form.</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="1" relname="nonvolitional-cause">  Triangles and X&apos;s where there 
should be words or descriptions, nothing to tell the user what the buttons 
are supposed to do.</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="31" relname="condition">  But, put the same controller into the hands of a 12 
year old, or even 6 year old,</segment>
    <segment id="31" parent="28" relname="span"> and suddenly they&apos;re racing down the slopes on 
a snowboard or fighting bad guys disguised as a Disney character.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="32" relname="circumstance">   After 
my hours of frustration dealing with these controllers,</segment>
    <segment id="32" parent="30" relname="span"> I began to wonder if 
developers had considered another alternative to the game pad currently 
used.</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="44" relname="span">  These games offer an outstanding opportunity for parents to interact 
with their children,</segment>
    <segment id="33" parent="27" relname="span"> but the complexity of the controller is a severe drawback.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="46" relname="span">

My research took me to an article about a game called Nautilus.</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="25" relname="span">  
(Stromberg, 2002) describes this 3-D gaming environment where up to 4 
players may interact with the environment as well as each other.</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="26" relname="list">  The game 
is centered around a room sized display,</segment>
    <segment id="34" parent="26" relname="list"> where the walls and floor display 
the game,</segment>
    <segment id="35" parent="26" relname="list"> and the floor contains sensors that determine movement and 
location.</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="26" relname="list">  The players interact with one another</segment>
    <segment id="36" parent="26" relname="list"> and have shared 
experiences about the game using team concepts and interactive settings.</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="45" relname="span">  
This HCI concept is a computer generated Human Centered Design 
approach.</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="22" relname="span">  The concept for interaction with the game comes from the 
intuitiveness of the control.</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="23" relname="list">  The control metaphors have reference points 
to natural body movements and actions,</segment>
    <segment id="37" parent="23" relname="list"> and are imbedded in the game 
allowing for multiple gaming environments and circumstances to be 
created.</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="38" relname="circumstance">    As the players move around the gaming environment,</segment>
    <segment id="38" parent="21" relname="span"> the sensors 
keep track of their movements</segment>
    <segment id="39" parent="23" relname="list"> and the players not only are able to interact 
with the game,</segment>
    <segment id="40" parent="23" relname="list"> but can share in the experience of winning the game while 
teamed with others.</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="24" relname="span">  This specific game is designed around a simulated sea 
environment</segment>
    <segment id="41" parent="14" relname="elaboration"> where the players have 4 minutes to save a dolphin before their 
air supply is depleted.</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="14" relname="elaboration">  The game allows for hand and finger movement to be 
detected without the use of any worn equipment.</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="42" relname="solutionhood">  The wall screen replaces 
the virtual environment created by a head mounted display,</segment>
    <segment id="42" parent="20" relname="span"> and eliminates 
the problems of movement limitations and simulator sickness.</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="48" relname="span">  IÂ’m looking 
forward to the release of this gaming environment,</segment>
    <segment id="43" parent="17" relname="elaboration"> and am interested to see 
how intuitiveness of game controllers changes with new developments in 
HCI, changing the perception of what gaming can be.</segment>
