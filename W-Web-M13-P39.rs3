In an article that talked about the best practices to use when designing an interface,</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="36" relname="span"> 
Larry Constantine conveyed that he is following something called usage-centered design 
of user-centered design in regards to web interfaces.</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="25" relname="span">  This usage path that Constantine 
suggested basically conveyed that one should design based on design principles,</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="2" relname="volitional-result"> and this 
will result in a good design for users to test in the end.</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="26" relname="span">  His suggested design principles 
were the following (p. 5):</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="24" relname="span">
Visibility, feedback, structure, reuse, tolerance, and simplicity</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="4" relname="elaboration">

The list above directly reflects with design principles that Preece, Rogers and Sharp bring 
up (p. 21).</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="23" relname="solutionhood">  The one that was a bit vague at first was tolerance, </segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="19" relname="circumstance">and upon looking at what 
he meant by this,</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="23" relname="span"> it was to all users to be able to recover from errors,</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="19" relname="background"> and this was one 
of Nielsens 10 usability heuristics (Preece, et al., 2002, p. 27).</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="28" relname="span">  

There was a feeling when reading this article that there was conflict to when it was 
appropriate to involve users in the design process.</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="7" relname="volitional-cause">  Because he made a distinction of 
user vs. usage centered design, and chose the latter,</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="27" relname="span"> he feels that users are bad to get 
involved in the design process early on.</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="33" relname="span">  His feeling is that design principles should guide 
the process up front and then let the users find issues at a later time with usability 
testing.</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="34" relname="span">  The choice of when to involve users seems to be an ongoing debate in the HCI 
world,</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="11" relname="volitional-cause"> because it has been a source of concern as to when and at what stage users need 
to be involved in the design process (Preece, et al., 2002, p. 283).</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="14" relname="antithesis">  Constantine does 
follow with has been conveyed about the focus on users characteristic (Preece, et al., 
2002, p. 170) of the interaction design process,</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="35" relname="span"> but he is looking at them as abstract 
models early on in the design (Constantine, 2002, p. 5).</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="29" relname="justify">   

Based on this article and the Preece textbook, </segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="22" relname="concession">it appears that the principles of design are 
universally accepted for use in all situations,</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="29" relname="span"> but when and how to involve users in the 
design process is an assessment that design teams must make on their own.</segment>
