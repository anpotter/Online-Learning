I liked a definition of intuition given by the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary as follows 
(Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, n.d.): </segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="38" relname="span"> immediate apprehension or cognition</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="2" relname="circumstance">

Also, when looking at synonyms of intuition,</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="23" relname="span"> the word instinct came up as one.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="35" relname="span">  

This thought of intuitiveness seems to relate to how someone would be able to correctly 
react to a situation with little or no chance to think about it.</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="32" relname="span">  People could be trained to do 
the right thing to gain some level of intuitiveness, such as swerving to miss a bad driver.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="34" relname="span">  
The hope would be that there would be some reflex reaction based on previous exposure 
to the situation to make the driver swerve.</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="18" relname="circumstance">  The problem is that a bad driver can come 
from any direction,</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="33" relname="span"> so how does the person that was trained respond to the different 
directions?</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="32" relname="elaboration">  What about musically talented savants that just know how to play a piano 
without any training at all?</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="36" relname="span"> 

How a computer application can be created to allow for intuitiveness is odd to me </segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="14" relname="span">
because I have time to think about what I will do and usually have the ability to reverse 
my actions.</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="29" relname="span">  However, one area of our Interaction Design textbook on page 23 that 
discussed mapping seemed show me what might be considered intuitive in any computer 
application, </segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="27" relname="span">but it still related to physical movement.</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="26" relname="span">  I do think that studying physical 
intuitive movements goes well when looking at video games and virtual simulators that 
can emulate physical interaction.</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="21" relname="span">  It was interesting that an alteration of the way a virtual 
figure moved in a video game led to children spending an average of 34% less time on 
that particular game level (Höysniemi, Hämäläinen, Turkki, &amp; Rouvi, 2005, p. 47).</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="25" relname="span">  The  
sideways movement of the virtual figure was changed</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="12" relname="nonvolitional-cause"> because it was observed that 
children physically moved sideways when controlling the figure.</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="31" relname="span">  This really brings home 
a point of how important it might be to build intuitive movements into virtual simulators</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="13" relname="nonvolitional-result"> 
so that the person being trained will have these movements corrected and/or reinforced 
for real life events.
