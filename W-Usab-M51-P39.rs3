I have something to add to the part of your discussion that says:</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="38" relname="span">
The only way to ascertain user expectations is to do user testing.</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="19" relname="elaboration"> No amount of study 
and debate will substitute.</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="36" relname="span">

I was reading an article that Jackob Nielson wrote on heurisitics</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="3" relname="elaboration"> and ran across an 
interesting statement.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="37" relname="span">  Nielson (1992) said that minor usability problems could be real 
usabiltiy problems that could not be observed in a user test (p. 378).</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="35" relname="span">  I could see how 
problems and expectations might cross into a grey area at times,</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="34" relname="span"> and would say that 
both heuristics(or other type of expert inspection) and user testing would be needed to 
ascertain user expectations in the long view of a product&apos;s development.</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="33" relname="span">

An example might be where users are brought in to test a web interface.</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="32" relname="span">  Users are 
expecting a quick checkout to purchase something.</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="22" relname="concession">  The first user really have to focus on 
entering in his credit card information correctly,</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="43" relname="span"> but  he succeeds.</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="20" relname="concession">  The next user has to 
focus just as hard</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="42" relname="span"> but the transcation itself is perceived as quick by the user</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="20" relname="elaboration"> and he only 
views the credit card entry as something you have to be careful in entering.</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="8" relname="elaboration">  Both users 
had to enter the credit card number as one long number like xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="8" relname="elaboration">  User 
expectations are met and the evaluators are none the wiser.</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="28" relname="span">

Now I come in as an expert reviewer,</segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="13" relname="elaboration"> and I am evaluating the credit card entry process.</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="29" relname="span">  
I might say that there should be dashes in between the blank area to enter my credit 
card</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="17" relname="span"> becuase this will visually match what a user sees on his credit card when typing it in</segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="25" relname="elaboration">
(heuristic where thre is a match between the system and the real world).</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="17" relname="elaboration">  It would look 
like xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx instead of xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx for data entry.</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="30" relname="span">  

I just went to a major department store website, nordstrom.com, to see if they put 
dashes for their customers&apos; credit card entry area.</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="16" relname="volitional-result">  They don&apos;t.</segment>
