    <segment id="1" parent="2" relname="background">
This past week at work I had what I consider a very intersting experience with several people in our User population.</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="30" relname="span"> 
My company is incorporating another implication into our intranet.</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="27" relname="span"> This application interfaces with our clinical (hospital information system (HIS), Lab, Rad, etc...) systems.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="28" relname="span"> The application will capture clinical information that is comprised of clinical data, financial data and operator flags that will be determined by each facility.</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="29" relname="span"> This new application will allow us to track number of infections and diseases we are encountering and what our follow up actions on this issues.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="5" relname="elaboration"> The statics gather sometimes need to be reported to regulatory agencies, which we are used to doing already with or without an electronic system.</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="31" relname="span">
As the Information Systems Director I am required to extract information from the ancillary systems (Lab, Rad) and the HIS.</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="32" relname="span"> My role is purely technical</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="33" relname="span"> and I fully depend upon clinicians to confirm the data.</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="34" relname="span"> We work very closely togethe to accomplish this goal.</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="9" relname="elaboration"> I had to interact with the Infection Contorl Practioner, the director of clincial quality improvement and the director of Laboratory Services.</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="23" relname="circumstance">
As I worked with these individuals in orde to build tables for this new system</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="40" relname="span"> it became apparent that none of us had seen a demo of the actual application we were trying to build.</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="24" relname="concession"> We were told that we would see a demo</segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="39" relname="span"> but this came after we were asked to provide build information.</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="14" relname="concession"> I am sure the application will not look much different than many of the ones we presently have for similar subjects.</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="41" relname="span"> But, the Users did not see it that way.</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="16" relname="preparation">
Morale of the story.</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="38" relname="span"> We are usually visual beings.</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="35" relname="span"> It helps A LOT to see what we are ttrying to accomplish in the form of a demo</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="17" relname="concession"> even if it is not perfect.</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="19" relname="concession">
In this case the developers have involved the users in a very imperfect manner.</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="36" relname="span"> I am sure we will be successful in accomplishing our task.</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="19" relname="evaluation"> However it could have been a little less frustrating.</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="47" relname="span"> 
By the way we will go live with this new app by end of March 2005.</segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="21" relname="elaboration"> Not much time as always.</segment>
