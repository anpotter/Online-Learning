I read an interesting article on the Web about the user experience and Websites that I 
thought I would share.</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="31" relname="span">  In a paper written by Ritchie Macefield called &quot;Reality Check&quot; two 
components of the user experience were discussed:</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="23" relname="list">  (1) the customer proposition,</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="23" relname="list"> and 
(2) a usable and acceptable web site.</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="26" relname="span">

In this discussion, the author says that the customer is considered to be the intellectual 
property that differentiates a business in today&apos;s market place.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="25" relname="span">  It is the very essence of 
what a business is</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="24" relname="span"> and no particular formulas exist for manufacturing one,</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="13" relname="nonvolitional-cause"> because it is 
considered a highly creative process.</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="27" relname="span">  On balance, he argues that it is reasonable to say 
that every business has to have at least one good customer proposition,</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="5" relname="elaboration"> and just 
because the product or service is offered on-line is not enough in itself to constitute a 
sufficiently differentiated customer proposition.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="41" relname="span"> The second component of the user 
experience is a usable and acceptable web site.</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="16" relname="circumstance"> During the 40 years or so that they have 
been designing information systems (IS) </segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="29" relname="span">it has been a constant struggle to make them 
usable and acceptable to their users.</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="17" relname="antithesis">  

In a related article having to do with users and Website Interaction written by Richard 
Whitehand, the author points out that even if you think your own web site is easy to use,</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="35" relname="span"> 
it is not.</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="34" relname="span">  Because good usability means that the intended users can achieve their goals </segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="9" relname="elaboration">
(e.g. find the information they are looking for, or order a product they want),</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="33" relname="span"> can use the 
site efficiently</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="19" relname="elaboration"> (e.g. that it is quick for them to finding the information they are looking 
for),</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="32" relname="conjunction"> and are satisfied and/or happy with the site and the way it works.</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="38" relname="span">  I felt that both 
articles shed some light on the important issue of user experience,</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="10" relname="elaboration"> and provided some 
background information about the user&apos;s goals and needs that are connected with the 
design aspect.</segment>
