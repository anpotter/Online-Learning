     The Medicare website was a great example of applying the senior-friendly guidelines 
for web design that the NIA/NLM has recommended.</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="12" relname="span">  My first thought when I visited the 
site was whether or not I had accidentally adjusted my screen resolution to a larger font 
size.</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="2" relname="elaboration">  In other words the font size was clearly legible, which is an important factor when 
attempting to accommodate for those individuals with poor or failing eyesight.</segment>

Links to various topics had on mouse click features which is another important factor for 
those with physical impairment.</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="1" relname="elaboration">  The wording and literacy content is also easily read and 
easily understood;</segment>

couldnt find a sitemap which would be helpful to outline all the various aspects and 
avenues of the site;</segment>

to specific areas at a broad outlook.</segment>

     The site is void of busy and distractible features that one might come to expect and 
possibly enjoy in todays websites.</segment>
