Speaking on keyboard design and user-friendliness,</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="34" relname="span">
my company recently purchased a few 100 new DELLS for our engineering department.</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="28" relname="span"> 
My team&apos;s priority was to deploy these new desktops,</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="2" relname="circumstance"> while minimizing any user 
downtime;</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="21" relname="span"> much easier said than done.</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="15" relname="nonvolitional-cause"> The main problem we ran into was the data 
transferring for each user.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="36" relname="span"> Anyway, by the time we were done with the project </segment>
    <segment id="29" parent="30" relname="span">
everything seemed ok,</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="29" relname="elaboration"> and all the users were much more satisfied with the performance 
of their new machines.</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="33" relname="span"> After a few days my team started getting many complaints that 
the new keyboards were a problem.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="24" relname="span"> How could they be a problem?</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="23" relname="list"> They were brand 
new,</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="23" relname="list"> they matched the new DELLs,</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="23" relname="list"> they had multimedia connections,</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="23" relname="list"> and they even had 
2 USB ports which enabled a user to plug their digital camera or any other USB device 
into their keyboard without having to use their PC.</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="31" relname="span"> So I was wondering just what the 
problem was.</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="27" relname="span"> It turned out to be the way the keys were designed on the keyboard.</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="26" relname="span"> The 
INSERT and DELETE keys were slightly arranged a bit different from the old keyboards.</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="20" relname="circumstance"> 
When a user depends on the certain key that they use so often</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="25" relname="span"> a small issue like this can 
create a huge problem.</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="33" relname="summary"> This is a good example of how keyboard design and user 
involvement can greatly just how satisfied your end-user base will be.</segment>
