Our class texts have similar definitions of user-centered design.</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="26" relname="span">  From what I gather user-
centered design focuses early on users and tasks, as well as getting users involved in 
providing information as to how the software is meeting these usability requirements.</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="23" relname="span">  In 
addition, user-centered design fixes the problem that users find using an iterative 
approach during the development lifecycle.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="25" relname="span">  Using an iterative approach and involving 
many end-users seems like a good way to achieve a user-centered application.</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="24" relname="span">  The 
degree to which these requirements are met is relative to each user&apos;s preferences.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="28" relname="condition">  If 
enough users are involved in the design process</segment>
    <segment id="28" parent="29" relname="span"> a design acceptable to most users 
should be achieved.</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="22" relname="span">  In addition, information from other areas of research such as the 
behavioral sciences can help achieve a user-centered application.</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="21" relname="span">  For example, the 
degree to which an application is easy to use or learn depends on the end-users.</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="8" relname="elaboration">  By 
involving many users in the design process as well as applying concepts from the 
behavioral sciences the odds of creating a user-centered product are increased.</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="20" relname="span">  It is 
also important to involve users with varying skill levels.</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="10" relname="elaboration">  For example, a novice user is 
likely to produce different error conditions than an advanced user;</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="10" relname="elaboration"> in addition an 
advanced user is more likely to provide a better gauge of the flexibility of a program.</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="18" relname="span">  
Another element to the user-centered approach to design could be the length of time the 
users are involved in testing.</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="19" relname="span">  Having users test an application over a long period might 
help in determining the memorability of an application.</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="16" relname="antithesis">  At first, it seemed like some of 
these elements such as efficiency and consistency could be designed into a product with 
less end user involvement;</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="17" relname="span"> however, the more I thought about it the more I realized to 
design a user-centered application one must measure the degree to which all of these 
elements are being met by getting user feedback.</segment>
