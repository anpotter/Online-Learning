In my department at work we just completed a project that migrated approximately 150 
users to our Active Directory Domain.</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="1" relname="elaboration"> It took about 2 months to complete because we 
have so many locations where these users work from.</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="18" relname="span"> I have learned so much about 
how important it is to include the user during any type of IT project in which their PCs 
are affected.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="8" relname="span"> Along with this new Domain came a bunch to group policy restrictions which 
limited their desktop use.</segment>

a huge difference in our lives</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="5" relname="elaboration"> like adjust their screensaver, change their desktop 
wallpaper, etc.</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="16" relname="span"> Our support group got all the complaints about this,</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="11" relname="concession"> even after they were 
all notified of these restrictions.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="14" relname="concession"> A few of our programs were changed around a bit,</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="14" relname="means"> but 
by working with the users from the beginning and gaining the knowledge of how they 
have certain programs configured</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="17" relname="span"> we are able to duplicate this on the new system, trying 
to keep them satisfied.</segment>
