    <segment id="1" parent="33" relname="span">Well, outside of being ugly as sin, there are a few problems with the site, in terms of 
being senior-citizen user centered.</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="23" relname="span">  The first thing I noticed was that you have to use the 
scroll bar on the right to view the information below, </segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="2" relname="circumstance">where you have the FAQ, contact 
information and more.</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="21" relname="span">  Most Web sites provide enough information on each page,</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="3" relname="elaboration"> and 
then provide a link to a second page in order to continue reading.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="26" relname="span">  Some non-technical 
seniors may have a problem with this feature.</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="1" relname="evidence">   The yellow, brown, blue, and white colors 
are all very boring and are a little hard on the eyes to read.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="27" relname="span">  The design is suppose to 
look like a file folder of some type, which is almost a thing of the past now.</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="25" relname="span">  It may have 
been designed for those seniors who remember and still appreciate the good-old days </segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="7" relname="circumstance">
when paper files were put away in filing cabinets.</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="28" relname="conjunction">  In a word, I think very little creativity 
was put into this site,</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="28" relname="conjunction"> and very few of the modern-day tools were used to build it.</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="29" relname="sequence">  
Nothing stands out and catches my eye,</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="29" relname="sequence"> nothing guides my attention to a certain area of 
the site,</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="29" relname="sequence"> and nothing keeps me from falling asleep when looking at it for more than 5 
minutes.</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="30" relname="span">  True, it does address the issues that seniors are concerned.</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="10" relname="elaboration">  Some seniors 
want to just find the facts, and donÂ’t really want all of the extras.</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="31" relname="span">  But, were not talking 
about window candy here,</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="12" relname="circumstance"> where special offers are flashing away in your face;</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="38" relname="span"> were 
talking about basic aesthetics,</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="19" relname="elaboration"> and there seems to be very little of that on this Web site</segment>
