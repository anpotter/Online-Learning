System A favors intuitiveness and fast learning, whereas
system B optimizes performance for the expert user. At
time t1 in Figure 1, system A would seem to be preferable
to system B. But at time t2, system B is clearly the
winner. Clearly, in this example, system B is harder to
learn at first, but once users overcome the initial obstacles,
they learn faster and become more proficient. This example
illustrates that an extrapolation of an analysis of short-term
performance to infer long-term performance is prone to
errors.</segment>
