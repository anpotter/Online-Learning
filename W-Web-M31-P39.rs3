It is an interesting article that you found</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="1" relname="elaboration"> and I am glad that people are trying to address 
the needs of the elderly in regards to Internet use.</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="22" relname="span">  From what I can tell, based on the 
two articles I am referencing, seniors are more interested in keeping in touch with family 
and friends than any other category...even over health related info.</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="15" relname="span">  It seems to me that 
they don&apos;t want information so much as communication as a primary motiviation for 
using the web.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="10" relname="antithesis">  While we might think, as a younger generation, that there are other 
concerns that the elderly should consider as more important, </segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="8" relname="span"> I suspect we really don&apos;t 
know how important simple communication is in our later lives</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="10" relname="circumstance"> until we are experiencing 
all of that frequently and in large amounts of discretionary time first hand.</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="24" relname="span">  To me, the 
usability principles I would pursue would be about designing applications which would be 
easy to use for communication.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="16" relname="span">  I would possibly build in chat and news group areas in 
the menus of these governmental, commercial or non-profit web sites</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="6" relname="volitional-result"> so that people 
could share their experiences with each other about what they are going through and 
what information they might need from these particular sites.</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="17" relname="span">  Anyway, I hope they have 
improved web sites for the elderly</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="7" relname="circumstance"> when I get older</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="19" relname="span"> because my eyesite has already 
gone a bit</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="18" relname="elaboration"> and I am sure there is more to come.  </segment>
