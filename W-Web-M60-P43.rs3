 Below is an excerpt from the article:</segment>

To develop standards that all voting machines would meet, the Help America Vote Act 
turned to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Project 1583 is the 
resulting effort and is intended, the IEEE summary says, to assure confidentiality, 
security, reliability, accuracy, usability and accessibility. To set standards, an IEEE 
working group first puts together a draft proposal, which it sends out for public comment. 
Then the draft must pass a vote by the members of the standards association, a subset 
of the IEEEs worldwide membership. </segment>

There are multitudes of references on the web that refer to flaws in the electronic voting 
system.</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="7" relname="elaboration"> The machines in Florida, as well many other states such as Illinois, are by 
Election Systems &amp; Software of Omaha, Nebraska.</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="7" relname="elaboration"> John Hopkins had been involved in 
studies indicating there were flaws with the software in the machines as well.</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="11" relname="concession"> In fairness 
to the company there was an upgrade applied in order to correct the problem</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="30" relname="span"> but I never 
really saw articles indicating that the fix was a good one.</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="13" relname="condition">

If one steps back and looks at the situation</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="32" relname="span"> perhaps we can say that we rushed to 
electronic voting too quickly.</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="28" relname="span"> We had a very bad experience in Florida that was live on 
national and international view for weeks.</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="16" relname="volitional-cause"> We wanted to have it correct it yesterday. </segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="27" relname="span">
Hence, there was not enough time to train the poll workers who in general are senior 
citizens.</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="26" relname="contrast"> We emphasize that it takes time to implement change management in an 
organization</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="26" relname="contrast"> and we pretend to do this across and entire state and the nation.</segment>

The concepts of HCI to involve users in the development plan did not seem very visible 
here.</segment>

At the sake of talking out both sides of my mouth I must say that the electronic machines 
have not produced any hanging chads.</segment>

I hope we can come up with a better system for the 2008 elections.</segment>
